 <h2 id="the-math-behind-this-model-difference-from-throw-on-earth">The math behind this model: “difference from throw on Earth”</h2>

<p>My purpose in creating a computer model was to learn more about a rotating environment. As I began building the model, I wanted a simple go-to measurement for the difference between a rotating throw and a throw on Earth. This provided me a fascinating physics problem. I wanted to know, if a person were to toss a coin straight upward in a rotating environment, how much would the Coriolis effect distort the toss? How far away would the coin land from their feet?</p>

<h4 id="set-up-the-problem">Set up the problem</h4>

<p>To fully understand what happens during our coin toss, we must use a perspective that is not rotating. When beginning to solve a physics problem, it is important to establish a coordinate system. This helps to make sense of what is going on.</p>

<p>The station is a virtual coordinate system with (0,0) at its exact center and the thrower at the very bottom. I imagined the station rotating clockwise.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/CoordinateSystem.png" width="300" height="300" /></div>

<p>Here are some conditions for this coin toss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At the moment of the throw, the person is standing at the bottom of the circle, at 270 degrees or 3π/2 radians.</li>
  <li>The person is holding the coin at 4 feet from the floor. This is the starting height.</li>
  <li>The person throws the coin straight upward at 14 ft/s, which would have sent the coin about 3 feet up in the air on Earth.</li>
  <li>The rotating space station has a diameter of 100 feet. It is rotating at the speed necessary to produce 1g of acceleration, or 100% Earth gravity at the floor.</li>
  <li>The coin experiences less than this amount of centripetal acceleration or “gravity” because it is not at the floor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The next picture is a diagram of the velocity components for the throw. Before the throw, the coin has a leftwards velocity ($V_x$) due to the clockwise rotation; the object also experiences the centripetal force upwards ($F_c$). The throw adds an upwards velocity of 14 ft/s (the throw speed); the centripetal force ceases. The velocity components define the overall direction that the coin travels through the air ($V$), which we will need to calculate so we can determine where it lands.</p>

<div class="center"><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/BeforeThrow.png" width="200" /><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/AfterThrow.png" width="200" /></div>

<h4 id="steps-to-solve-the-problem">Steps to solve the problem</h4>

<p>Now that I have set up the problem, I will explain the next steps. Ideally, I would like a single equation that can solve the problem for me. Unfortunately, such an equation would be messy and impossible to simplify, so we will solve this in steps. We want to find how far away a coin would land from the thrower’s feet. To find this, we need to find the coordinates of where both the thrower and the coin would end up.</p>

<p>First, we need the magnitude and direction of the coin’s velocity after it launches. Using this, we can solve for its landing coordinate and the time it elapsed in the air. We can then use the time elapsed in the air to find where the thrower would end up in an equivalent time period. We can use this to find the separation between the coin and the thrower’s feet.</p>

<p>Here are the steps to solving our math problem:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calculate the magnitude and direction of the coin’s velocity through the air</li>
  <li>Find the coin’s landing coordinates</li>
  <li>Calculate the time elapsed as the coin traveled through the air</li>
  <li>Calculate the arc swept by the thrower during this same time</li>
  <li>Calculate the thrower’s final coordinates</li>
  <li>Calculate the distance between the thrower’s feet and the coin where it lands</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="starting-velocity">Starting velocity</h4>

<p>We need the vertical and horizontal velocity components of the coin. The vertical velocity has been given to us as 14 ft/s, the throw speed. The horizontal velocity is currently unknown, but it is based on the speed it was rotating before the throw. Using this information, we can calculate which direction the coin is moving.</p>

<p>Before we solve for the coin’s initial horizontal velocity, please note that the coin does not feel the same force of “gravity” as the person’s feet do on the floor of the station. Its distance to the station’s center is smaller than the station’s radius because you are holding it in your hand. The coin starts at a height of 4 ft from the floor. Thus, the coin’s horizontal velocity would not be <em>quite</em> the same as if it were touching the floor.</p>

<p>We can calculate the coin’s velocity using the equations for centripetal acceleration, which produces the station’s “gravity”. Here is our equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a=\frac{v^2}{r}</script>

<p>Variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a is the acceleration (in ft/s/s) felt at a given radius on a rotating object</li>
  <li>$v$ is the horizontal (tangential) velocity at this radius in ft/s</li>
  <li>r is the radius, or distance to the center of rotation in feet</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not know either the acceleration felt by the coin or its current horizontal velocity. We will have to calculate it based on the station’s rotation rate, which we can get from the floor, where the acceleration is 1g. The rotational speed in radians per second will be equivalent at the floor and at the coin.</p>

<p>Rotational, or angular, velocity (rate of spin) is related to linear velocity (straight-line motion). This relationship is defined by $v=\omega*r$ where $\omega$ is the rotational rate of the station in radians/second.</p>

<p>We can use this with our centripetal acceleration equation to get rate of rotation at the floor by replacing $v^2$ with $\omega^2*r^2$. This gives us:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a=\omega^2r</script>

<p>Rearrange:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\omega=-\sqrt {\frac {a}{r}}</script>

<p>In this formula:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$a=-32.174$ ft/s/s (1g), the acceleration at the floor</li>
  <li>$r$ is the radius of the station, or 50 feet.</li>
  <li>$\omega$ is the rotational speed in radians per second. It is negative because the station is rotating clockwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have the rate of rotation, we can calculate the horizontal velocity of the coin. The radius at the coin will be 50 ft minus 4 ft, or 46 feet. The velocity will be negative because the coin is traveling left.</p>

<p>If you put all of this together coin using $v=\omega*r$, using the rotation rate from the floor and the radius at the coin, you get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_x = -\sqrt {\frac{a}{r_{s}}}*(r_{s}-h_{c})</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$v_x$: the horizontal velocity of the coin, which we are calculating</li>
  <li>a: the acceleration of the station, 32.174 ft/s/s</li>
  <li>$r_{s}$: the radius of the station, 50 feet</li>
  <li>$h_{c}$: the starting height of the coin, 4 feet</li>
</ul>

<p>$v_x$ works out to -36.89991$ ft/s.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-coins-landing-coordinates">The coin’s landing coordinates</h4>

<p>We can use the velocity components of the coin to find its landing coordinates. The coin is traveling up and to the left in a straight line; the slope of the path it follows is the fraction of the two velocity components, $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$. The landing coordinates will be where this line intersects with the station, a circle.</p>

<p>The equation for our line in slope-intercept form: $y = mx - r_c$</p>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m$: the slope, or $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$. It will be <em>negative</em> because the coin is moving left and up.</li>
  <li>$r_c$: the y-intercept. This is the radius where the coin starts, mapped to our coordinate system. This is <em>subtracted</em> because it is below the center.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that $v_x=-36.89991$ ft/s, $v_y=14$ ft/s, and $r_c=50-4=46$ ft, this is the line that makes up the coin’s path:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=-.379405x-46</script>

<p>Now, we need to find where this line intersects with the circle that is the station. Here is our formula for the circle:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + y^2 = r_s^2</script>

<ul>
  <li>Note: $r_s$ is the radius of the station.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can cheat for a moment and solve for our coordinates using an <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator">online graphing website</a>:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/IntersectPoint.png" width="250" height="250" /></div>

<p>In this image, you can see the path of the coin and its final intersection with the floor on the left. The coin starts at the y-intercept; everything to the right of that is irrelevant. The numbers in this picture will help us validate our answers later.</p>

<p>Now, we will develop a formula to solve for the x coordinate. The computer model needs a formula! I am leaving $\frac{v_y}{v_x}$ as the variable $m$ for simplicity’s sake.</p>

<p>Here are our equations again:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + y^2 = r_{s}^2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=mx-r_{c}</script>

<p>Put them together:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2 + (mx-r_{c})^2 = r_{s}^2</script>

<p>Next, rearrange and simplify to a quadratic equation (format $0=ax^2+bx+c$) by multiplying the y term and combining like terms:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x^2+m^2x^2-mxr_c-mxr_c+r_c^2=r_s^2</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0=(1+m^2)x^2-2mr_{c}x+(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2)</script>

<p>The quadratic formula:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac {-b\pm\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}</script>

<p>Plug in our variables and simplify:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{2mr_c\pm\sqrt{ 4m^2r_c^2-4(1+m^2)(r_c^2-r_s^2) }} { 2(1+m^2)}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{mr_{c}\pm\sqrt{m^2r_{c}^2-(1+m^2)(r_{c}^2-r_{s}^2)}}{1+m^2}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{mr_c\pm\sqrt{m^2r_c^2-r_c^2+r_s^2-m^2r_c^2+m^2r_s^2}}{1+m^2}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=\frac{mr_c\pm\sqrt{r_s^2(1+m^2)-r_c^2}}{1+m^2}</script>

<p>This is our formula for the x-coordinate of the coin. The operator we use depends on what quadrant the coin lands in; in other words, it depends on the conditions of the throw. In this problem, the correct value will be the answer that is negative because the coin goes to the <em>left</em>. The equation correctly gives us -39.098 when we solve with the (-) operator.</p>

<p>Now we need to solve for the y-component that matches this x-component. Here is the equation for our line again:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y = mx - r_c</script>

<p>Inserting -.379405 for $m$, 46 for $r_c$, and -39.098 for $x$ gives us an answer of y=-31.166. The coin’s final coordinates are (-39.098, -31.166).</p>

<p>Once more, here are our final formulas for the coin’s landing coordinates:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_c=\frac{mr_c-\sqrt{r_s^2(1+m^2)-r_c^2}}{1+m^2}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y_c = mx_c - r_c</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m=\frac {v_y}{v_x}$. Both $v_x$ and $m$ are negative because the coin is moving left.</li>
  <li>$r_{c}$ is the radius where the coin starts, or the y-intercept.</li>
  <li>$r_{s}$ is the radius of the station.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="time-elapsed">Time elapsed</h4>

<p>Now that we have the coin’s landing coordinates, we can solve for the exact time elapsed using kinematics. To calculate this, we need the distance traveled; however, we only need this in one dimension. We will use the initial and final x-coordinates. The coin travels from 0 to $x_f$, and its velocity is $v_x$.</p>

<p>Basic kinematics tells us that $d=vt$ for objects that are not accelerating. We can rearrange this and plug in our values. We get:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">t=\frac{x_f}{v_x}</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$t$ = the time elapsed</li>
  <li>$x_f$ = the final x-coordinate of the coin</li>
  <li>$v_x$ = the velocity x-component</li>
</ul>

<p>This solves to almost exactly one second, or 1.060s.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-persons-final-coordinates">The person’s final coordinates</h4>

<p>We can use the time variable to calculate the angle a person will rotate while the coin is in the air. This will give us the final coordinates of the person.</p>

<p>We have already calculated the station’s rotation rate in the beginning of our problem. This is $\omega$, in radians/second, and this is negative because the station is moving clockwise (counterclockwise is positive). Remember, $\omega=-t*\sqrt{\frac{a}{r}}$.</p>

<p>If $\theta_p$ is the total arc swept by the person, then you would expect $\theta_p=\theta_f-\theta_0$, the final minus the initial angles. The person starts at an angle of $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ (270 degrees). The person is also sweeping a negative arc.</p>

<p>With rotational kinematics, we can calculate this arc swept by the person:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_p = \omega t</script>

<p>Put the equations together:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_f-\theta_0=\omega t</script>

<p>Rearrange:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_f = \theta_0 + \omega t</script>

<p>We can also think of this in terms of the station’s acceleration:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\theta_f = \theta_0 - t*\sqrt{\frac{a}{r}}</script>

<p>We have just calculated the person’s final angle in the station. Now, we have a set of polar coordinates: we have the final angle and the radius. We can convert these polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates using the equations:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x=r*cos(\theta_f)</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y=r*sin(\theta_f)</script>

<p>Our final equations for the person’s x and y coordinates:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x_p=r_s*cos(\frac{3\pi}{2} - t*\sqrt{\frac{a}{r_s}})</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y_p=r_s*sin(\frac{3\pi}{2} - t*\sqrt{\frac{a}{r_s}})</script>

<p>Our variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$r_s$ = the radius of the station</li>
  <li>$a$ = the rotational acceleration, which equals earth gravity (32.174 ft/s/s)</li>
  <li>t = the time elapsed while the coin is in the air</li>
</ul>

<p>The person’s final coordinates are (-37.563, -33.001).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="the-final-answer">The final answer</h4>

<p>Now that we have both the landing coordinates of the coin and the person’s final coordinates, we can calculate the straight line distance between the two using the Pythagorean theorem. This formula gives us our answer:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">d = \sqrt{(x_{c}-x_{p})^2 + (y_{c}-y_{p})^2}</script>

<ul>
  <li>$x_c$ and $y_c$ are the coin’s final coordinates</li>
  <li>$x_p$ and $y_p$ are the person’s final coordinates</li>
</ul>

<p>This tells us that the coin landed 2.393 feet away from the person’s feet.</p>

<p>This value is the straight-line distance to the coin from the person’s feet. The model shows a scale along the floor; if you follow the tic-marks on the screen, you will discover the <em>curvilinear</em> distance to the coin, which may be slightly different. The model also calculates the curvilinear distance; you can find this in the stats menu.</p>

<p>The model breaks up the path of the coin into about 100 pieces, reorients each of these points to the person’s perspective at that moment, and moves real-time between these points to make an arc on the screen. The next article discusses how this is done.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>It takes complex calculations just to understand a simple motion in a spinning environment; thus, it seems to me that Coriolis effects and forces are best understood with computer models.
