<h3 id="rotation-research-regarding-nausea">Rotation research regarding nausea</h3>

<p>Living in a centrifuge may be nauseating and difficult to get used to.</p>

<p>Minimizing a space station’s rotation rate would reduce the nausea astronauts experience. We can reduce the revolutions per minute (rpm) required to produce 1g by increasing the station size; however, it is unclear what rotation rate would be desirable, and large stations would be expensive. When we finally build a spinning space station, we should experiment with several rotation rates.</p>

<div class="conditionalright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left: 79px;"><i>Are you dizzy yet?</i></div>

<p>Unlike astronauts entering zero gravity, rotating astronauts must adapt to more than one sensation. While rotating, each direction of motion produces a different effect on the inner ear. This means that individuals would need to adjust to both the rotation itself and to sudden changes in direction. Windows might also be disorienting on a rotating space station.</p>

<p>Nausea research on Earth began in 1958 in the <em>Slow Rotating Room,</em> a facility in Pensacola, Florida. NASA placed individuals in a rotating room for several days.</p>

<div class="conditionalright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left: 20px;"><i>NASA's Slow Rotating Room</i></div>

<p>The <em>Slow Rotating Room</em> generated some important findings. Study participants quickly learned to restrict their head movements, otherwise they would feel sharp nausea reactions (“acute nausea”). Over time, these individuals adjusted and became less restricted.</p>

<p><a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070001009.pdf">This page</a> explains: “Although few adverse effects are present when rotation rate is less than 1 rpm, higher rates produce motion sickness (similar to that occurring during the acute period of adaptation to weightlessness).” Researchers found that their test subjects could adapt to 3 rpm.</p>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://coriolis-station.netlify.app#&amp;diameter=200&amp;units=m"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=200 m</p><p>Start height=1.2 m</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=4 m/s </p><p>Gravity=100%</p></div></a></div>
<p>A space station would need to be 200 meters to produce 3 rpm at full gravity. The International Space Station is 109 meters wide by comparison. Press this button to see a coin toss emulated on a 200-meter space station (the coin lands 20 cm away).</p>

<p>Higher rotation rates would be more difficult to adapt to. In 10 rpm, individuals showed no adaptation after 12 days. The study indicated it is possible to <em>build up</em> to this rate in small increments, about 1-2 rpm per day; this might be an impractically long adjustment. My model’s default settings display a station at about 11 rpm (the speed for 1g with a diameter of 50 feet).</p>

<p>It is unclear how significant these studies are. A centrifuge in outer space would rotate you vertically, not horizontally.</p>

<p>A 1993 study in Udine, Italy focused on <em>vertical</em> rotation in a bicycle-powered centrifuge. Participants were able to move their heads without acute motion sickness at rates up to 19-21 rpm. Unlike the Slow Rotating Room, this study did not expose participants over several days; this would be very difficult.</p>

<p>It is not clear how well our bodies would adapt to rotation in space.</p>

<h4 id="construction-strategies-to-prevent-nausea">Construction strategies to prevent nausea</h4>

<p>There are a few strategies that could be helpful for reducing nausea when building a rotating space station.</p>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://coriolis-station.netlify.app#&amp;gravity=33"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=50 ft</p><p>Start height=4 ft</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=14 ft/s </p><p>Gravity=33%</p></div></a></div>
<ul>
  <li>We could build a space station that produces less than 1g. This would not need to rotate as quickly, and it might produce some positive health benefits.</li>
</ul>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://coriolis-station.netlify.app#&amp;gravity=200"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=50 ft</p><p>Start height=4 ft</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=14 ft/s </p><p>Gravity=200%</p></div></a></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Studies have indicated that <em>intermittent</em> gravity is helpful. Would a higher rotation rate be tolerable if it is only for an hour a day? Try the coin toss in 2g!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible to simulate gravity by rotating two capsules connected by a tether. With this strategy, we could build a spinning environment with an arbitrarily large radius, allowing us to reduce the spin rate. The astronauts in Gemini 11 briefly studied this phenomenon. This strategy may prove less expensive than building an enormous station, though the tether may require exceptionally strong materials.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A modular station could be expanded over time, allowing us to reduce the rpm requirements or increase the gravity capability. Gravity would be highest at the ends and lowest in the middle.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Reducing the spin rate would also reduce the Coriolis effect, another desirable outcome.</p>
