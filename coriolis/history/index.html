<h3 id="the-history-of-research-on-rotation">The history of research on rotation</h3>

<p>Artificial gravity from spinning has been popularized by science fiction; this is where our perception of it comes from. In the real world, a spinning space station has never built, and no space agency has active plans to build one; nonetheless, NASA’s archives are filled with proposals for one. It is interesting to take a break from fiction and see what real efforts have been made to learn more about spinning in outer space.</p>

<p>Organizations like NASA and Roscomos (the Russian space agency) have been working feverishly to try to make life in space viable. Space agencies may eventually choose to construct spinning artificial gravity habitats to solve the health problems of weightlesness.</p>

<p>Here is some of the history of spinning in outer space:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Gemini 8 mission (March 1966) accidentally produced 4 g’s after a thruster incorrectly fired. The fast rotation caused intense nausea, and the astronauts nearly blacked out from the g-forces. The mission was aborted.</li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left:20px"><i>Gemini 11</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/Gemini_11_Agena.jpg" width="270" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>The Gemini 11 mission (September 1966) purposely rotated two capsules connected by a 36-meter tether to produce 0.0005 g. The astronauts did not feel the gravitational force (the perception threshold is about 0.2 g), but they observed objects slowly floating toward the floor of their capsule. They reported it had been “an interesting and puzzling experience.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://coriolis-station.netlify.app#&amp;diameter=45&amp;speed=0&amp;units=m&amp;gravity=.05"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=45 m</p><p>Start height=1.2 m</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=0 m/s </p><p>Gravity=.05%</p></div></a></div>
<p>Press this green button to emulate the gravity of the Gemini 11 mission. It takes 23 seconds for an object to land after dropping it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 1973, NASA’s only concern with zero gravity was motion sickness, which was only a problem for the first few days in orbit. This was the NASA flight surgeon’s position: “The magnitude of the motion-sickness problem experienced by astronauts to date does not appear to suggest clearly the need for design and incorporation of artificial gravity system in near-future space vehicles.”</li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="color:red; margin-left: 90px; font-weight:bold;"><i>Kosmos 782</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/Kosmos_782.jpg" width="270" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Soviet space program was initially very interested in artificial gravity in space. As early as 1961, the Soviets began studying how animals responded to various g-forces in parabolic flight (flights that do not reach orbit).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1975, on Kosmos 782, the Soviets centrifuged animals in space. Fish and turtles were centrifuged at 1 g for 20-days in a 75 cm diameter centrifuge. The researchers did not find any differences between either the centrifuged animals, animals housed in 0g, or Earth-bound animals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;"><i>Skylab</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/Skylab.gif" alt="Skylab Giphy" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The American crews on Skylab took advantage of the large open compartment and ran around the curved circumference. Running in a circle created gravity. They reported no difficulty with either locomotion or motion sickness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The negative effects of weightlessness became clearer during long-duration missions on Russian space stations such as Mir.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several studies on Earth have looked at long-term bed rest, which produces similar health effects to zero gravity. A 1998 study in Tokyo found that one hour a day in a centrifuge prevents blood volume from dropping in a bed rester and maintains the blood-pressure reflex. In 2005, NASA conducted similar studies in their Short-Radius Centrifuge in Houston.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption" style="margin-left: 5px;"><i>Off-axis rotator</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/rotator.jpg" width="270" /></div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In 1998, the European Space Agency built an “off-axis rotator” for the ISS. This device centrifuged humans for seven minutes at a time at several speeds. Subjects said they felt like they were standing on their heads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In December 2014, NASA launched a fruit-fly centrifuge to study the effects of artificial gravity on the immune system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The scientific community periodically comes up with new gravity ideas, though we will never fully understand life in a spinning environment until we create an environment for outer space.</p>

<h4 id="actual-spacecraft-proposals">Actual Spacecraft Proposals</h4>

<p>There have been many proposals for a rotating spacecraft. None of them have been built, but they are interesting and show the mindset of those who have advocated this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wernher von Braun proposed a rotating spacecraft for NASA in 1952.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><div class="floatcaption"><i>1952</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/vonbraun_early_wheel_concept_cropped.jpg" alt="von Braun station" width="250" /></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>

<ul>
  <li>The next picture is an interesting example of an early study into spinning space stations. The 1969 design below requires a few revisions to work. The center corridor would need to be an elevator or a ladder. Also, you would be unable to stand in the long cylindrical containers; they are oriented in the wrong direction.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><div class="floatcaption"><i>1969</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/Artificial_Gravity_Space_Station.png" alt="1969 concept" width="250" /></div>
<div class="widebreak"></div>

<ul>
  <li>This next image is for the Rotating Mars spacecraft, a 1989 concept idea. A space station using this tethered method could have an arbitrarily large diameter. An especially large space station at 1g may require exceptionally strong tethers using future materials such as carbon nanotubes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="center"><div class="floatcaption"><i>1989</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/1989Concept.png" width="250" /></div>

<div class="tryParent"><a target="_blank" href="https://coriolis-station.netlify.app#&amp;diameter=1800&amp;units=m"><div class="TryIt">Try it!</div><div class="tooltiptext"><p>Diameter=1800 m</p><p>Start height=1.2 m</p><p>Angle=0°</p><p>Speed=4 m/s </p><p>Gravity=100%</p></div></a></div>
<ul>
  <li>In 1975, NASA designed a massive theoretical ring station, a “Stanford torus,” as a thought experiment. The Stanford torus has a proposed diameter of 1800 meters (1.1 miles), the minimum size to produce 1 rpm with full gravity. Press the green button to see a coin toss emulated on it; the coin toss lands 8 cm (3 in) away. Perhaps someday we will reach out to the stars with a station like this one. <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasas-beautiful-dreams-self-sufficient-space-colony-revealed-1631672">Here</a> is an interesting news story about it.</li>

<ul>
  <li>In 2011, NASA proposed the rotating Nautilus-X as a possible stopover for astronauts embarking on long-distance missions; the suggested price was only about $3bn.</li>

  <li>The Gateway Foundation, a private company, currently wants to build a rotating spacecraft using SpaceX’s Super Heavy launcher, still being developed.</li>
