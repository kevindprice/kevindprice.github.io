 <h3 id="space-stations-and-artificial-gravity-in-science-fiction">Space stations and artificial gravity in science fiction</h3>

<p>Mankind has dreamed of the stars for many thousands of years, but our understanding of outer space today is a modern concept. The concept of building a rotating space station has followed the modern space era; rotation continues to be the only method we know of that can produce a gravity environment in space. We have very little experimental knowledge about life in artificial gravity, and most of our experience with it comes from the dreams of science fiction. This idea has been proposed and developed by several successive generations of scientists and science fiction writers.</p>

<p>The first time a space station appeared in science fiction was in 1869. Everett Hale published a short story, “Brick Moon,” in the Atlantic Weekly magazine. His fictional space station was launched as a navigational aid for the people on Earth, and individuals on board communicated to Earth by Morse code by jumping in unison.</p>

<div class="floatright" style="width:150px"><div class="floatcaption">An engraving of the projectile in <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i></div><img src="/coriolis/assets/img/From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon_by_Henri_de_Montaut_39.jpg" width="150" /></div>

<p>The dream of space travel began with Jules Verne’s fictional story, <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em> (1865), where a group of enthusiasts build a massive projectile to launch them to the moon. The Russian scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky was inspired by Jules Verne’s story and applied real physics to it in 1903, theorizing how space travel could realistically be accomplished. He was a philosopher and science writer on the topic of space travel, or astronautics. He wrote nearly a hundred published pieces about space topics! Tsiolkovsky was the first person to suggest a rotating space station, but he did not develop the idea.</p>

<p>Herman Potočnik was first to develop Tsiolkovsky’s idea with a book, <em>The Problem of Space Travel</em> (1929). He was the first to think through the design and construction aspects of such a station. This Slovene rocket engineer wrote a plan for space travel and for establishing humanity’s presence in outer space.</p>

<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/spacecraft_discovery.jpg" width="150" /></div>
<p>Stanley Kubrick’s film <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (1968) was the first to bring spinning space stations to the popular imagination. The film’s science was based on the work of Wernher Von Braun, who built on  Herman Potočnik’s idea in 1952 as a proposal for NASA. The film’s <em>plot</em> is loosely based on a short story by Arthur C. Clarke, “The Sentinel,” first published in 1951. In the film, a group of astronauts pursue a mysterious monolith located at Jupiter.</p>

<p>Generations of science fiction writers have continued the theme of traveling into space. Some of them have incorporated spinning space stations, and some of them have not. Either way, the idea of traveling into the great beyond of outer space has provided plenty of room for imagination.</p>

<p>No science fiction film has ever incorporated the Coriolis effect into their filming, but this would be technically infeasible. We have never built an artificial gravity environment. Despite this, the films continue to be highly imaginative and explorative.</p>

<p>I believe the original Star Trek TV series is worth mentioning. Though the spacecraft does not rotate to produce gravity, the highly imaginative craft ventures into the unknown to encounter many philosophical and difficult scenarios. The Starship Enterprise featured a diverse, egalitarian crew, which was a novelty for the time period. The actress Nichelle Nichols—Lt. Nyota Uhura on the show—later became a recruiter for NASA and helped diversify the astronaut corps. Thus Star Trek actually changed the face of the American space program!</p>

<p>A few of my personal favorite science fiction films are <em>Gravity</em> (2013), <em>Interstellar</em> (2014), <em>The Martian</em> (2015), and <em>Passengers</em> (2016).</p>

<div class="floatright"><div class="floatcaption"><i>The Avalon</i> from <i>Passengers</i></div>
<img src="/coriolis/assets/img/cropped-avalon.jpg" width="230" /></div>

<p>In <em>Gravity</em>, a cascade of satellite collisions threatens the life of several astronauts on a spacewalk servicing the Hubble Space Telescope; they discover a way to return to the ground. <em>Interstellar</em> involves a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole to survey potentially habitable planets in another solar system. <em>The Martian</em> involves an astronaut stranded on Mars after a severe dust storm who must creatively find a way to escape to Earth. <em>Passengers</em> involves an astronaut traveling on a slower-than-light spaceship to another star system who improperly wakes up from a hibernation pod, finds himself stranded alone, and ultimately comes to the rescue to help save the ship and his fellow hibernating travelers. All of these movies (except <em>Gravity</em>) involve rotating spacecraft and teach something about the nature of gravity or spinning environments.</p>
