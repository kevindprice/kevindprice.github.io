<p>This article accompanies a computer model that shows motion on a spinning space station. The green link opens the model.</p>

<h1 id="spinning-space-stations-and-the-coriolis-effect">Spinning Space Stations and the Coriolis Effect</h1>

<p><img class="conditionalright" src="/coriolis/assets/img/RotatingStation.png" width="240" style="border-radius: 10px; padding:5px; background-color:darkblue;" /></p>

<p>No one has ever built a spinning space station before. By spinning a space station like a centrifuge, astronauts could be held to the floor like gravity. What would it be like in such a place?</p>

<p>Objects move differently in a spinning environment due to a phenomena called the Coriolis effect. If you were to toss something in the air, it would not land where you expect it to. The farther around the circle you spin while the tossed object is midair, the more distorted its path will look.</p>

<p>I sought to learn more about life in a spinning environment by building a computer model. Whether or not we <em>should</em> build a spinning space station is up to history to decide; however, it seems likely that someday there will be such an environment, and when it exists, the Coriolis effect will be a major part of life there.</p>

<h4 id="should-we-build-a-spinning-space-station">Should We Build a Spinning Space Station?</h4>

<p><img class="conditionalright" src="/coriolis/assets/img/rotating.gif" width="250" style="border-radius: 10px" /></p>

<p>There are arguments both for and against building a spinning space station.</p>

<p>Creating a spinning environment would be expensive, and it is unclear how well astronauts could adapt to a spinning world. Each direction of motion would produce a different sensation, so the body would need to adapt to each direction differently. The stars on the computer model page are shown spinning slower than reality because it is too easy to get dizzy looking at it (of course, it is the person that is actually spinning, not the stars).</p>

<p>On the other hand, producing gravity may prove essential to counteract the health effects of weightlessness on deep-space missions. Life without gravity causes vision changes, reduced blood volume, a weakened immune system, premature aging, weakened bones and muscles, and more. The result of weightlessness is similar to prolonged bed rest. If future astronauts must spend several years in space traveling to and from Mars, then these health effects will be a problem. One of the main objectives of astronaut Scott Kelly’s recent year-long trip to space was to learn more about these health effects.</p>

<p>I believe that we should build a spinning space station for the purpose of learning more about this type of environment. We cannot know if this environment will be helpful to astronauts if we never try it. When we eventually do build a spinning environment, it will be interesting to learn more about how astronauts adapt to the Coriolis effect.</p>

<h4 id="can-we-get-rid-of-the-coriolis-effect">Can We Get Rid of the Coriolis Effect?</h4>

<p>As we increase the size of the spinning space station, the Coriolis effect decreases. However, it would be impossible to build a station large enough to eliminate it. So no, we cannot eliminate the Coriolis effect.</p>

<p>The improvement you see as you increase space station size is logarithmic; you need to increase the size by an order of magnitude to see a small decrease in the Coriolis effect. I have modeled our toss against increasing station size on a logarithmic graph. On Earth, a toss thrown straight up would land exactly at your feet, 0 cm away.</p>

<div class="center"><img id="smallMargin" src="/coriolis/assets/img/CoriolisGraph.png" class="wideimage" /></div>

<p>This graph assumes the toss starts at a height of 1.2 meters, goes straight up at 4 m/s, and has 1g of gravity at the floor. This is the default setting for the computer model.</p>

<p>Try the computer model for yourself so you can see how different data points affect a throw.</p>
